# diaphone — working notes for Claude Code

## What this is
Derives the **minimal set of cross-linguistic phonemic points** for 12 languages
(EN DE ES FR IT LA EL RU AR HU ZH JA) such that **no language's minimal pair is ever
merged** — and proves it. The eventual goal is a universal notation: one label char per
point, one systematic char per modifier.

## The core idea (don't break this)
- A **point** is a *base segment*: `(place, manner, voice)` for a consonant,
  `(height, backness, round)` for a vowel. Nothing else defines a point.
- **Modifiers** — `long, nasal, palatalized, pharyngealized, labialized, aspirated,
  rhotic` — are stripped off to get the base. They ride on top and **never create points**.
- Two phonemes in different languages **share a point** iff their base tuples are equal.
  Two phonemes in the **same** language may share a point only if a modifier separates
  them. This guarantees `phoneme → (point, modifiers)` is **injective per language**.
- **Minimal set = the distinct base tuples.** `derive()` builds it and validates the
  injectivity invariant; any residual collision means the feature grid is too coarse
  (fix by adding a feature or a modifier, as we did for `ə/ɝ` → rhotic, `j/ɥ` → labialized).

## Invariant (must always hold)
`merged contrasts == 0`. Enforced by `tests/test_invariants.py` and `diaphone --strict`.
If a data edit breaks it, either the data is wrong or a new modifier/feature is needed —
never "fix" it by deleting a phoneme.

## Layout
```
data/features.yaml          feature scales + modifier list (drives distance metric)
data/languages/<code>.yaml  one file per language — THIS is where you edit inventories
src/diaphone/model.py       base tuples, modifier→diacritic map, strip_mods
src/diaphone/loader.py      load + expand modifier series (long/nasal/secondary)
src/diaphone/derive.py      minimal points, injectivity validation, near-merge finder
src/diaphone/report.py      JSON + Markdown output
src/diaphone/cli.py         `diaphone` entry point
out/                        generated (gitignored): points.json, mappings.json, report.md
```

## Run / test
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
diaphone                 # regenerates out/ and prints a summary
diaphone --strict        # non-zero exit if any contrast is merged (use in CI)
pytest                   # runs the invariant guardrails
```

## Data conventions
- `data/languages/*.yaml` short keys: `pl mn vc` (consonant place/manner/voice),
  `hi bk rd` (vowel height/backness/round), `orth` native spelling, `st` status
  (`phonemic|marginal|loan`), `note` free text.
- Modifier series expand automatically: `long_series: [...]`, `nasal_series: [...]`,
  `secondary_series: [{type, applies_to:[...]}]`, or inline `mod: [rhotic]` on a phoneme.
- **Allophones are NOT phonemes** — record them in `note`, never as their own entry.
  Points come from contrastive units only.
- Mandarin: lenis series entered as voiceless-unaspirated; the fortis series is generated
  via `secondary_series: aspirated`. Mandarin therefore uses no voiced stop points.

## Current state (v0.1)
72 points (51 consonant · 21 vowel), 7 modifiers, 0 merged contrasts, 398 phoneme records.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (done):** the database + derivation + invariant. ← we are here.
- **Decision gate:** review the near-merge list in `out/report.md` and decide which
  optional fusions to accept (Spanish dentals, JA `ɸ→f`/`ɯ→u`, the sibilant retroflex
  pairs, etc.). Record decisions in data.
- **Phase 2 (not started):** assign the label char per point + one systematic char per
  modifier, driven off `out/points.json`. Do NOT start phase 2 until the point set is
  frozen.

## Open decisions
- LICENSE not chosen yet (Sz' decides — mirror weCan conventions if relevant).
- Greek is Modern; swap to Ancient if we want to pair it with Latin.
